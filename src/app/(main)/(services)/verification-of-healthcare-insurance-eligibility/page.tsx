                                Insurance eligibility verification has become increasingly crucial with the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. Nowadays, it's possible for an ACA patient to have insurance one month but not pay premiums in subsequent months. Qualified health plans must pay claims for services rendered during the first month of the grace period, while carriers will delay claims until the second or third month. This delay means that patients must pay for services rendered or their insurance premium during this period. If patients cannot afford these payments, any pending physician claims during the 2 and 3 months will remain unpaid, resulting in an increase in bad debt collections.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Verifying a patient's insurance eligibility is crucial to ensure coverage for provided services, minimize denials and appeals, and expedite payments at the correct rates. Denied claims caused by inactive coverage, out-of-network services, or unauthorized procedures can result in significant revenue loss, and therefore, should not be disregarded.
