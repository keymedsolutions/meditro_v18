                            <p>Verifying insurance eligibility has gained importance since the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). A patient may possess active insurance coverage for one month but lose it the next month due to untimely premium payments. Qualified health plans are required to cover services rendered in the first month of the ACA's grace period, but claims made during the second and third months may be denied or delayed if the premium remains unpaid. This leads to a shared reason for significant revenue decline and increased bad debt collection for providers.</p>
<p>At Key MedSolutions, we offer comprehensive Eligibility Verification Services to help healthcare providers confirm patient coverage before delivering services. By promptly identifying inactive coverage, we avoid claim denials and ensure timely reimbursements. It reduces administrative complexity and financial risk, optimizing your revenue cycle.</p>
