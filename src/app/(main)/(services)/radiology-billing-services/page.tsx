                  Radiology billing services involve the complex process of billing and coding for radiology procedures, such as X-rays, MRI scans, CT scans, and ultrasounds. Any errors in billing and coding can result in delayed or denied payments from insurance companies, making it crucial to have accurate and efficient billing and coding services.
