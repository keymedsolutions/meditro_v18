                                At Key MedSolutions (KMS), our team of experienced billers are well-versed in the intricacies of getting physicians enrolled in new networks and payers, and can expedite the process of credentialing with government agencies.

                                In addition, our billers can help with payer contracting, evaluation, and renegotiation, which is a critical aspect of revenue cycle management. Many practices only set up their contracts once and allow them to automatically renew without any negotiations, which means they may be missing out on substantial revenue. Our billers can assist with evaluating and renegotiating your payer contracts on an annual basis, providing quantifiable results that directly impact your bottom line.

They are experts in handling the complexity of Medicare enrollment services, which can be time-consuming and costly with other services.
