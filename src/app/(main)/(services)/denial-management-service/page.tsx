                                It's important to note that the terms "claim denial" and "claim rejection" are often used interchangeably, although they are different. A rejected claim has not been processed because it has not been received or accepted by the payer. A rejected claim must be corrected and resubmitted for processing. On the other hand, a denied claim has been received, adjudicated, and deemed unpayable by the insurance company. Denied claims represent unpaid services and delayed or lost revenue for your practice.
