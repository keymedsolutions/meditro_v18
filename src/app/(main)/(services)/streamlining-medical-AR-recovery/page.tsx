                            <p>Optimizing medical AR recovery is not an easy feat, particularly in this era of complicated health insurance. With changing payer plans, co-pays, co-insurance arrangements, and increased numbers of patients choosing high deductible health plans, payment complexities and uncertainties have grown. Physicians need detailed strategies to reduce reimbursement problems and hasten cash flow. Key MedSolutions offers comprehensive medical billing services to busy doctors, with net collections maximized to their fullest extent. As a respected provider of Receivable Recovery Services, we commit to enhancing financial performance via focused follow-up and recovery efforts.</p>
<p>It is common for doctors to possess high amounts of medical A/R overdue more than 180 days, unless they establish consistent and proactive accounts receivable recovery follow-ups on timely billings. Amending, contesting, investigating, and/or resubmitting claims is, however, time-intensive and necessitates skill. With a restricted number of personnel assigned to this task, physicians may struggle to meet their goal of substantially reducing or eliminating outstanding A/R and gathering as much revenue as possible quickly. Key MedSolutions offers efficient Accounts Receivable Recovery Solutions that empower practices to regain control of overdue receivables.</p>
<p>As the leading Collection Agency in North Carolina, Key MedSolutions ensures that your outstanding A/R are reduced or eliminated, enabling physicians to maintain high-quality care as we drive financial success.</p>
