                                Maximizing medical AR recovery is a challenging task, especially in today's complex health insurance landscape. With evolving payer plans, patient co-pays, co-insurance agreements, and more patients opting for high deductible health plans, payment ambiguities and complexities have increased. Physicians require comprehensive strategies to minimize reimbursement issues and accelerate cash flow. Key MedSolutions provides end-to-end medical billing services for busy physicians, ensuring that net collections are realized to their fullest potential.

                            <p>
                                It's common for physicians to face excessive amounts of medical A/R that are greater than 180 days outstanding, unless they initiate specific and consistent active accounts receivable follow-up on current billings. However, researching, correcting, appealing, and/or re-filing claims is a time-consuming process that requires expertise. With a limited number of staff devoted to this task, physicians may struggle to achieve their goal of substantially reducing/eliminating outstanding A/R and collecting as much money as possible in a short period of time.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Key MedSolutions ensures that the outstanding A/R is reduced/eliminated, and physicians can focus on providing quality care to their patients.
